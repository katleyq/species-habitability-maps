Marine aquaculture has the potential to be an important sustainable food source to meet global food demands, while limiting our carbon footprint and saving water. The overarching goal of this project is to create a reproducible workflow for identifying optimal locations for aquaculture.

This project aims to do the following:
- Find optimal locations for marine aquaculture using oysters as a model.
- Find potential for marine aquaculture within each West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone.
- Build a product that outputs a species suitability map by West Coast EEZs when users input a species name, suitable temperature range, and suitable depth range of a particular species.
